# Project-of-Statistical-Analysis

The following project is to give the user an insight of different topics within statistics which is an important factor within machine learning. 
The aim is so that the reader/user will be equipped with the basics to advanced understanding of different topics within statistics.

Statistics is a branch in mathematics that collects and analyzes numerical data for the purpose of giving us insight concerning the given data. Statistics can be known as the backbone of machine learning that provides it the tools and techniques to analyze and interpret data. It gives us 
a theoretical framework from which different machine learning algorithms are built.

Also, I want to point out that none of my passages or definitons will be generated by an AI, 
because this also an outline of my journey as I learn statistics, please enjoy! I plan to constantly update this as I learn. :)
